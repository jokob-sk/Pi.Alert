### Create a simple n8n workflow

N8N can be used for more advanced conditional notification use cases. For example, you want only to get notified if two out of a specified list of devices is down. Or you can use other plugins to process the notifiations further. The below is a simple example of sending an email on a webhook.

### Specify your email template 
See [sample JSON](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/blob/main/back/webhook_json_sample.json) if you want to see the JSON paths used in the email template below

```
Events count: {{ $json["body"]["attachments"][0]["text"]["events"].length }}
New devices count: {{ $json["body"]["attachments"][0]["text"]["new_devices"].length }}
```
