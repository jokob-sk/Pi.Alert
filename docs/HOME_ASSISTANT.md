# Overview

PiAlert comes with MQTT support, allowing you to show all detected devices as devices in Home Assistant. It also supplies a collection of stats, such as number of online devices.

## âš  Note 

- Please note that discovery takes about ~10s per device.
- Deleting of devices is not handled automatically. Please use [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) to delete devices in the broker (Home Assistant), if needed.
