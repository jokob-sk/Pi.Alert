## API endpoints

PiAlert comes with a simple API. These API endpoints are static files, that are periodically updated based on your settings. 


### When are the endpoints updated

The endpoints are updated when objects in the API endpoints are changed.

### Location of the endpoints

In the container, these files are located under the `/home/pi/pialert/front/api/` folder and thus on the `<pialert_url>/api/<File name>` url.

### Available endpoints

You can access the following files:

  | File name | Description | 
  |----------------------|----------------------| 
  | `notification_text.txt` | The plain text version of the last notification. |
  | `notification_text.html` | The full HTML of the last email notification. |
  | `notification_json_final.json` | The json version of the last notification (e.g. used for webhooks - [sample JSON](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/blob/main/back/webhook_json_sample.json)). |
  | `table_devices.json` | The current (at the time of the last update as mentioned above on this page) state of all of the available Devices detected by the app. |  
  | `table_pholus_scan.json` | The latest state of the [pholus](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/tree/main/pholus) (A multicast DNS and DNS Service Discovery Security Assessment Tool) scan results. |
  | `table_plugins_events.json` | The list of the unprocessed (pending) notification events (plugins_events DB table). |
  | `table_plugins_history.json` | The list of notification events history. |  
  | `table_plugins_objects.json` | The content of the plugins_objects table. Find more info on the [Plugin system here](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert/tree/main/front/plugins)|
  | `language_strings.json` | The content of the language_strings table, which in turn is loaded from the plugins `config.json` definitions. |  
  | `table_custom_endpoint.json` | A custom endpoint generated by the SQL query specified by the `API_CUSTOM_SQL` setting. |
  | `table_settings.json` | The content of the settings table. |
  | `app_state.json` | Contains the current application state. |
  
  Current/latest state of the aforementioned files depends on your settings.

### JSON Data format

The endpoints starting with the `table_` prefix contain most, if not all, data contained in the corresponding database table. The common format for those is:

```JSON
{
  "data": [
        {
          "db_column_name": "data",
          "db_column_name2": "data2"      
        }, 
        {
          "db_column_name": "data3",
          "db_column_name2": "data4" 
        }
    ]
}

```

Example JSON of the `table_devices.json` endpoint with two Devices (database rows):

```JSON
{
  "data": [
        {
          "dev_MAC": "Internet",

    ]
